<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time that slay!</h2>

<h3>Dune</h3>
<p>So well done, cinematography is exceptional, and Timmy is the perfect Paul.</p>

<h3>Snoogle Society</h3>
<p>I watched this movie with Blake, my love, which was a great time.</p>

<h3>The Attack of Snoogler George</h3>
<p>This movie was scary - I wouldn't want to be attacked by George or his boss, Norrie.</p>
